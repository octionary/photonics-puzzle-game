next to run and reset buttons should be load solution, which loads a reference solution to the problem. this also requires you to make and store some reference solutions to the puzzles that you have tested actually pass the test. If you cannot easily make a solution that passes the test, consider updating the puzzle first.
every component in the palette should have a small clickable i in a small square box in upper right corner of its palette box that opens an information popup with information about the component, including explanation of parameters relevant formulas to solve puzzles, e.g. how resonance wavelength depend on circumference (and by extension radius) for ring resonator.
