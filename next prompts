next to run and reset should be load solution, which loads a reference solution to the problem. this also requires you to store reference solutions that you have tested actually pass the test.
every component should have a small clickable i in a small square box in upper right corner of its palette box that opens an information popup with information about the component, including explanation of parameters relevant formulas to solve puzzles, e.g. how resonance wavelength depend on circumference (and by extension radius) for ring resonator.
